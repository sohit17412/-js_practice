        var c=30
      }

      ///console.log(a);// does not recognise becous a is not defined outside and you didnt acees inside the if condition so the scope of a is inbetween the {....  }
      //console.log(b);//does not recognise becous b is not defined outside and you didnt acees inside the if condition so the scope of b is inbetween the {....  }
      console.log(c);//{30} this is the issue thats why we dont use var 

      //{}= it is called scope
